# Data Analyst
Hi, I'm Alex, a self-taught Data Analyst
## About me
Having recently completed a retraining program in Data Analytics, I am eager to apply my new skills to data analysis roles. With over 15 years of experience in designing and managing educational programs, I bring expertise in project management, data collection, and analysis. Iâ€™m now looking to bring these strengths to the field of data analytics, contributing valuable insights and helping organizations make informed decisions.
