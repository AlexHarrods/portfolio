  I recently completed a certification in Data Analytics and have over 15 years of experience in project management, data collection, and analysis from designing educational programs. 
  I'm skilled in Python, SQL, Tableau, and statistical analysis, and I enjoy unveiling the stories within data to help make good decisions. 
  I'm excited to bring my analytical skills and leadership experience to a data-driven team, to contribute to meaningful projects and help organizations achieve their goals.
