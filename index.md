<div style="text-align: justify">In order to analyze gender pay disparities, I first examined The Ohio State University 2023 Combined Earnings dataset, which includes non-student employeesâ€™ compensation details like regular pay, overtime, bonuses, and gross pay. Then, I used Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation, alongside Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize the data through bar plots, count plots, box plots, and heatmaps. Finally, I conducted statistical tests, including the Chi-Square Test and Mann-Whitney Test, revealing significant gender pay disparities, underrepresentation of females in higher pay brackets, and inequalities in overtime distribution.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">I conducted exploratory data analysis on the Ohio State University 2023 Combined Earnings dataset to explore earnings distribution and position group-based disparities using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. Then, I applied machine learning techniques like the Isolation Forest to detect and analyze outliers. Finally, I trained regression models, including Huber Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree, to handle extreme values</div>
